# World-Covid-Tracker
This is an interactive Viz which shows how many COVID cases and deaths across the differet countries. Check out the Viz to see which countries have flattened the curve 

**To view this viz :**

1) Have Tableau desktop installed in your PC and download the twb file 

2) Use the Tableau Public link to go to my profile. The Viz can be selected from my profile and viewed on the browser with no additional softwares.


**How to use the viz?**
1) The story consists of multiple dahsboards. Use the play button to start the intreactive viz and it will automatically go through differrent dates starting from Jan 1 2020
2) The other dashboards change the the values according to the stats for that particular day
3) On the right bottom one particular country can be selected to view thier new case and death rate for the day
4) Top left dashboard shows a world map that conveys the total cases and deaths around the world

P.S. Please be patient to see the full potential of the viz because during the early stages (Jan-Mar) there are not much cases and the viz is pretty empty. Towards the start of May the viz gets more data and there are lots of things to observe
